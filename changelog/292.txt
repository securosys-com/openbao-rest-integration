```release-note:feature
**Transactional Storage**: Plugin developers can now take advantage of safe
  storage modification APIs when the underlying physical storage supports
  them. The `physical.TransactionalBackend` and `logical.TransactionalStorage`
  types allow developers to begin read-only and writable transactions,
  committing or rolling back the desired changes.
```
```release-note:improvement
storage/raft: Add support for transactional storage semantics.
```
