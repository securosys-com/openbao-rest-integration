```release-note:feature
**Remove Mount Table Limits**: Using transactional storage, we've split the
auth and secret mount tables into separate storage entires, removing the
requirement that the entire table fit into a single storage entry limited by
`max_entry_size`. This allows potentially hundreds of thousands of mounts on
a single scaled-up server.
