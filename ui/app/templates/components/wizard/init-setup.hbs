      This is the very first step of setting up an OpenBao server. OpenBao comes with an important security feature called a
      "seal", which lets you shut down and secure your OpenBao installation if there is a security breach. This is the
      default state of OpenBao, so it is currently sealed since it was just installed. To unseal OpenBao, you will need to
      provide the key(s) that you generate here.
