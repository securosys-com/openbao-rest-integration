Enabling the file permissions check via the environment variable `VAULT_ENABLE_FILE_PERMISSIONS_CHECK` 
allows OpenBao to check if the config directory and files are owned by the user running OpenBao. 
It also checks if there are no write or execute permissions for group or others. 
OpenBao allows operators to specify the user and permissions of the plugin directory and binaries 
using parameters `plugin_file_uid` and `plugin_file_permissions` in config if an operator needs those to be different. This check is disabled by default.
